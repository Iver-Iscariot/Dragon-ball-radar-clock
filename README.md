Silly little thing i wanna do. Basically going to be a pocket watch-style clock, with two rings of 12 LED's (hour/minute).
At the press of the top button, the hour and minute (rounded to closest five) will pulse a couple of times, like in the anime

As this will be a novelty item that i only use once in a while, i will forgo a proper RTC, and just rely on the MCU itself for timekeeping. 
To work with the one-button interface of the original, I will set it such that a long-press will set the time to 12 o'clock, so you will simply set it at 12 am or pm
